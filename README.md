## Reflection
- Developed as part of the Lighthouse Labs Web development bootcamp.
- I set out to build a deployment pipeline focusing heavily on effective testing of React apps.
- Achieving a higher than 80% test coverage was more challenging than expected, but I was very impressed with the Cypress API.
- Being my first time using CircleCI, I look forward to taking a deep dive post bootcamp, and exploring more of what it has to offer.
